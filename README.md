# 🪙 CryptoText Analytics

## 📋 Project Overview

CryptoText Analytics is an advanced web application built with Streamlit that combines cryptocurrency market analysis with state-of-the-art AI tools. The project leverages both historical and real-time market data to deliver:

- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes language models (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo) to analyze news sentiment and generate comprehensive financial analyses.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Functionality**: Implements a system that retrieves context-relevant documents (PDF, HTML, text) and generates precise answers to user queries based solely on processed data.
- **Technical Analysis**: Computes key market metrics, technical indicators, and price trends using data sourced from CoinGecko.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays market data, sentiment analysis, and cryptocurrency comparisons through dynamic, interactive charts powered by Plotly.

## 🏷️ Application Layout and Features

The application features several tabs to help you navigate its functionality:

### Price Analysis
- Presents real-time and historical price charts for a selected cryptocurrency.
- Includes technical analysis indicators, daily returns distribution, and key metrics (volatility, Sharpe ratio, etc.).
