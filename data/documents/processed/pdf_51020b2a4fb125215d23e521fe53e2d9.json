The rally faltered in late D ecem ber w hen \n the Federal Reserve reduced its planned 2025 rate cuts from  fou r to tw o, despite a \n m od est 0.25%  cut during the m on th, triggering a sharp m arket cor rection  that w iped \n over US$0.5T from  the cryptoc urrency m arket capitalization . \n ●  After a stellar year, including m ultiple all-tim e highs, Bitcoi n clos ed the year w ith a \n ~123.4%  year-to-date (YTD ) m arket cap grow th.

This w as exem pliﬁed by projects like H yperliquid, w hich faced a \n US$1B ou tﬂow  and a 20%  drop  in their native tok en. This w as driven by con cerns over \n N or th Kor ean hacking after Talor  M on ahan, a W eb 3 security expert, identiﬁed a surge in \n N or th Kor ea address activity. \n In con trast, the stablecoin  m arket cap rem ained stable, hovering arou nd US$240B w ith \n m inim al ﬂuctuation s since D ecem ber 17. This difference allow s on e to infer that TVL \n decline w as prim arily due to the depreciation  of  crypto asset prices rather than a \n fundam ental shift in user behavior  or  signiﬁcant capital ou tﬂow s from  D eFi prot oc ol s. \n Sola na experienced a signiﬁcant dow nturn, w ith its TVL drop ping by US$1.1B, reaching \n US$8.01B, a 12%  decline. This decrease reﬂected a broader slow dow n in netw or k activity, \n including a 7%  drop  in daily active addresses. Key D eFi platfor m s like Jito saw  TVL \n reduction s, w ith Jito itself los ing 28% , bringing its TVL to US$2.66B.

This increase highlights a clear trend of  \n m arket con solid ation , as the num ber of unique buyers and sellers has gradually declined \n since N ovem ber. Few er participants are now  driving a larger share of  transaction s, \n signaling the grow ing prom inence of  high-value trades. This shift is largely fueled by \n substantial institution al investm ent, such as Andreessen H or ow itz’s partnership w ith \n O penSea to establish a ‘Creator  Legal D efense Fund.’ Addition ally, the rise of  native tok en \n drop s from  N FT exchanges and projects has created new  incentives, further prop elling \n m arket activity. \n Pudgy Penguins underpinned this grow th w ith a 141.4%  rise in vol um e, driven by the \n launch of  its $PEN GU tok en.
